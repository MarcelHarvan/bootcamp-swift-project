Project Boilerplate
=====================

Use this project as start point to build your own screen / project during the ProDigi Practical Developer Course.

### Static Files

For example, if you create a folder called `CaioScreen` you will be able to add other files / folders inside of it.

### Dependencies

For those that want to use any third party framework please use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#carthage--)
Just add your 3rd party framework directly to Cartfile and run Carthage.
